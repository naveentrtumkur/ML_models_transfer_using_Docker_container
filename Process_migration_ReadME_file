# In order to migrate the running process and affected files, i.e from one container to destination container,
we have a tool called CRIU.

--> CRIU checkpoints saves the container instance by saving the running processes and files affected.
--> These can be later migrated from container on machine-1 to another container on machine-1 ot machine-2, and can resume execution.

The applications or baselines to check this functionality:-
1) Simple program that prints the current hostname and Ip address
2) Simple Multivariate Linear Regression
-> Data Generating process
-> Output predictor process



1. Create a docker container with a specific name Ex: busyBox

2. Deploy/run  sample application on top of this container

3. Run the $docker logs command.

4. checkpoint the status using CRIU tool

5. Go to /var/lib/docker/containers/<container-ID>/checkpoints/<checkpoint name>/
 and verfiy the checkpoint is successfully created

6. Transfer these checkpoints to the new container.

7. Restart the container and check that the application resumes (i.e taking logs and they match the point after teh last checkpoimnt was taken)
