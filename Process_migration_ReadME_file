# In order to migrate the running process and affected files, i.e from one container to destination container,
we have a tool called CRIU.

--> CRIU checkpoints saves the container instance by saving the running processes and files affected.
--> These can be later migrated from container on machine-1 to another container on machine-1 ot machine-2, and can resume execution.

The applications or baselines to check this functionality:-
1) Simple program that prints the current hostname and Ip address
2) Simple Multivariate Linear Regression
-> Data Generating process
-> Output predictor process
